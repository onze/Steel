== Steel ==

This project is an entity-based game engine, that makes use of the following libraries:
- Ogre3d (rendering)
- OIS (input system)
- libRocket + MyGUI (UI) (currently trying out different UI solutions to move away from libRocket)
- Bullet (physics) + btOgre
- Inotify (file changes monitoring on linux)

---

As of now, the engine is in its very early stages of development, and is not reaaly usable yet.

Files include a short, hardcoded CMakeLists.txt known to build the engine under linux. Steel may eventually support windows/mac/whatnot.
