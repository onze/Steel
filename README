== Steel ==

This project is an entity-based game engine, that makes use of the following libraries:
- Ogre3d for 3d rendering
- libRocket for UI

Entities are managed by Steel itself.

The engine includes an in-game editor.

As of now, the engine is in its very early stages of development, and is not usable in any way.
