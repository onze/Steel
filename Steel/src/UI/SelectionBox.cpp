         The next two functions set the projection and view matrices to be the identity. Projection and
         view matrices are used by many rendering systems (such as OpenGL and DirectX) to define where
         objects go in the world. Since Ogre abstracts this away for us, we won't go into detail about
         what these matrices actually are or what they do. Instead what you need to know is that if you
         set the projection and view matrix to be the identity, as we have here, we will basically create a
         2D object. When defining this object, the coordinate system changes a bit. We no longer deal with
         the Z axis (if you are asked for the Z axis, set the value to -1). Instead we have a new coordinate
         system with X and Y running from -1 to 1 inclusive. Lastly, we will set the query flags for the object
         to be 0, which will prevent the selection rectangle from being included in the query results.*/

         number between 0 and 1 for the x and y coordinates, yet we need to convert these to numbers in the range
         -1, 1. To make matters slightly more complicated, the y coordinate is backwards too. The mouse cursor in
         CEGUI defines the top of the screen at 0, the bottom at 1. In our new coordinate system, the top of the
         screen is +1, the bottom is -1. Thankfully, a few quick conversions will take care of this problem. */
